## Recommendations
- Work with Tennessee’s Department of Education on aligning SAT’s scope with what TNReady provides
- Call for greater push to make SAT the more preferred test within Tennessee

## Conclusions
- Recommendations on improving participation rate in Tennessee is greatly dependent on cooperation with the Education Department
- Follow-up will need to be done should they be willing to work together to enforce implementation of SAT state-wide
- More insights could be gathered if we can drill down our information to the schools within the state to understand the dynamics and the performance of the students from the various schools
